## PHP CodeSniffer rules for Magento 2

### Introduction
There are already many PHP CodeSniffer rules out there to aid in Magento 2 development:
- https://github.com/magento/marketplace-eqp
- https://github.com/magento-ecg/coding-standard
- PSR-1, PSR-2, possibly PSR-12

However, some best practices still need to be integrated. Like not using the Object Manager in PHTML
templates, not using `setTemplate` in Blocks and using namespaced classes for Virtual Types. This
repository forms an effort to come up with more advanced rulesets than there currently are.

### Contributions
Any contributions are welcome. Let's use the **Issues** to address new rulesets that are needed.
